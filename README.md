Mobile Application Recommendatiion System for Mobile Data Plan
(B.TECH PROJECT).

# Idea 
With the vast amount of mobile data plan available, students must put a lot
of effort in finding a mobile data plan that is the best value for money or
the best for their heavy usage needs. Thus, this project proposes a recommendation
system to aid students in the selection process of a mobile data
plan. Further, hybrid filtering will be applied in the development process of
this system to recommend a few suitable mobile data plans.
